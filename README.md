Web Cartography - Class Project
===============================

### By David Mendoza - August 30, 2017

Goal: Tell a story you are personally engaged with via an interactive map.

Steps:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Proposal: Create a proposal on the problem, story & data needs for your project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Beta Map: Put your data on a map!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2a. Beta data pipeline (if applicable): create a full pipeline for your data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Final Map Experience: present map to class on **August 30th**!

#### Timeline

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✔️ August 7th - Proposal

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✔️ August 14th - Data pipeline proposal (if applicable)
* August 16th - Beta Map
* August 21st - Data pipeline implementation
* August 30th - Final map

We will have class time weekly to work on projects and address any questions or roadblocks. If you want to bounce ideas off me before drafting a full proposal or starting any part, please do!


### 2. Beta Map

**Due August 16th**

Put your data on a map! This should be a mvp type map. The goal is to show me (and yourself) that the data can be put on a map and give us the opportunity to start seeing what stories we can tell with the data.

#### Example

Joe's live trimet map (link todo)


### 3. Final Map Experience

Build your final map and be prepared to present it to class on August 30th.
